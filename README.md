# ProjectPomegranate

This is the code and documentation repository for the magnificant Project Pomegranate. We are in the business
of nefarious online bot killing!

### Why are we using GitHub?

We understand that everyone that wants to help is not a software developer or even interested in working on anything
technical. However, what we do get from this platform is the ability to share documentation, data, code, and project plans
in a consistant fashion. If you're not familiar with using GitHub check out the documentation here: (GitHub Docs)[https://guides.github.com/introduction]
